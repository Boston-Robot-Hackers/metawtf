# hello_world_algorithm.py — minimal reference exploration algorithm
# Author: Pito Salas and Claude Code
# Open Source Under MIT license

# The smallest thing that plugs into the F12 pluggable seam and still drives the
# robot. Read this as the template for writing a new exploration algorithm.
#
# The contract (see explore_context.py -> ExplorationAlgorithm protocol):
#   - expose two attributes the manager node reads:
#       latest_clusters: list[list[int]]   (frontier-specific; a non-frontier
#                                            algorithm just leaves it empty)
#       latest_diag: dict | None           (extra telemetry; None if you have none)
#   - implement next_goal(ctx) -> GoalDecision
#       GoalDecision.new_goal((x, y)) to send a world-frame goal;
#       GoalDecision.done() when finished (ends the session immediately);
#       GoalDecision.blocked() when targets exist but none are usable this tick.
#
# The node calls next_goal once (or a few times per tick if a goal maps outside
# the global costmap) whenever it has NO active goal. It pursues each returned
# goal to completion before asking again. GoalDecision.done() ends exploration
# straight away — no NO_FRONTIER_PATIENCE wait.
#
# NOTE (feature F23, from issue I12): latest_clusters / latest_diag are frontier concepts leaking
# onto a general protocol — this algorithm has no clusters, so it fakes []/None.
# That fakery is exactly the evidence backing I12; kept as-is until I12 lands.
